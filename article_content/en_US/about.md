## Intro | About us

Here is the about page of Betahub. Betahub is a gathering place for people who love to try new things. My original intention of establishing this website is to help people get information related to Apple Developer Beta more easily.
At that time, I found that getting Apple Developer Beta updates was problematic for most developers. It was difficult because of the following reasons:
There were a few ways to get the update.
The update is not released in time.
There was no website to collect this related information.

So with the help of some supporters, I established this website, Betahub. I bought an Apple Developer developer account and put the profile on the website for everyone to use.

Within a few months, this website has received more than 3 million visits. The report of iOS Beta has also accumulated millions of readings. We have received thousands of dollars donations from all over the world. Then comes version 2.0.

In version 2.0, we have further improved the update experience of Apple Beta. With the help of @0xJacky and @Hintay, we have updated the UI design and localized the interface for obtaining the official firmware in iPSW.me to solve the problem of slow access.

This is the first time (it should be the first in China) to grab firmware of the beta system from the official website of Apple Developer.

The next version, version 3.0,  is a version that has experienced many setbacks. Due to tight time, complicated tasks, and conflicting ideas, although we wrote lots of code, it was still "dead in the belly" in the end. In the following two years, we did not release any updates.

When it comes to version 4.0, it's already two years since the last update. We improve a lot. We refactored the front-end and back-end architecture, rewritten 90% of the code and learned the previous lessons. There is only one purpose for us:  take the Betahub to next level.

All in all, we will strive to provide a better and more complete environment and service for everyone who supports us. Thank you for your continuing support and encouragement.
